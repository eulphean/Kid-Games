# Kids-Games
As part of Brookly based new-media artist [Peter Burr's](http://www.peterburr.org/) solo exhibition [Responsive Eye](https://www.tttelematiccc.com/responsive-eye) at Telematic Media Arts in San Franscisco, Amay Kataria collaborated with him to create [Kids Games](https://amaykataria.com/#/kidgames) - an Augmented Reality project that reconstructs Pieter Bruegel's sixteenth century painting “Kinderspiele”, where hundreds of adult-looking children absorb themselves in foolish games. The digital work is superpositioned on a real-world sculptural space prepared as an intersection of three custom planar grids, through the lens of a portable tablet. On the outskirts of this static arrangement, a solitary figure restlessly explores.

The project is developed using Unity's ARFoundation framework and runs on iOS and Android devices.
